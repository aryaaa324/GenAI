This repository contains the basic concepts of Generative AI and its projects. 
## 🤖 Generative AI (GenAI)

Generative AI (GenAI) refers to a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content, such as text, images, audio, video, and code, based on patterns learned from existing data. It uses machine learning models, particularly deep learning architectures like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) 🎨, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) 📊, and Transformer-based models (e.g., GPT, BERT, DALL·E) 📝, to generate human-like outputs.

GenAI is widely used in applications like:
- **Text Generation** (ChatGPT) 📝
- **Image Synthesis** (DALL·E, MidJourney) 🎨
- **Voice Cloning & Speech Synthesis** (Bark AI, Tortoise TTS) 🎤
- **Drug Discovery** 💊

It enables automation, personalization, and creativity across industries like entertainment 🎬, healthcare 🏥, and finance 💰.
