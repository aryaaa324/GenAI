# Generative AI
This repository contains the basic concepts of Generative AI and its projects. 
## 🤖 Generative AI (GenAI)

Generative AI (GenAI) refers to a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content, such as text, images, audio, video, and code, based on patterns learned from existing data. It uses machine learning models, particularly deep learning architectures like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) 🎨, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) 📊, and Transformer-based models (e.g., GPT, BERT, DALL·E) 📝, to generate human-like outputs.

GenAI is widely used in applications like:
- **Text Generation** (ChatGPT) 📝
- **Image Synthesis** (DALL·E, MidJourney) 🎨
- **Voice Cloning & Speech Synthesis** (Bark AI, Tortoise TTS) 🎤
- **Drug Discovery** 💊

It enables automation, personalization, and creativity across industries like entertainment 🎬, healthcare 🏥, and finance 💰.

## 🚀 Applications of GenAI
- **Text Generation** (ChatGPT, Bard) 📝
- **Image Synthesis** (DALL·E, MidJourney) 🎨
- **Voice Cloning & Speech Synthesis** (Bark AI, Tortoise TTS) 🎤
- **Music Composition** 🎵
- **Drug Discovery & Healthcare** 💊🏥
- **Automated Code Generation** (GitHub Copilot) 💻
- **Finance & Fraud Detection** 💰


## 🔬 Types of Generative AI Algorithms
### 1️⃣ Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
GANs consist of two neural networks:
- **Generator 🏗️**: Creates fake data resembling real data.
- **Discriminator 🛡️**: Evaluates whether the generated data is real or fake.
Both networks train together in a competitive process, improving each other's performance.

### 2️⃣ Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
VAEs work with an encoder-decoder architecture:
- **Encoder 🔍**: Compresses input data into a latent space representation.
- **Decoder 🎨**: Reconstructs data from the latent space.
They use probabilistic methods to generate diverse and smooth outputs.


## 🔍 Differences Between GANs and VAEs
| Feature         | GANs 🎨 | VAEs 📊 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| Architecture  | Uses a Generator & Discriminator | Uses an Encoder & Decoder |
| Training      | Adversarial (Competitive) | Variational (Probabilistic) |
| Output Quality | High-Quality, Realistic | Smooth, but May Be Blurry |
| Stability     | Harder to Train | More Stable |
| Applications  | Image Generation, Deepfake | Data Reconstruction, Anomaly Detection |


## 🤖 Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
RLHF is used to fine-tune AI models using human preferences. It helps:
- Improve model safety and alignment with user expectations.
- Reduce biases in AI-generated outputs.
- Make responses more engaging and human-like (e.g., ChatGPT fine-tuning).
